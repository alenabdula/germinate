## Getting Started

**Tools & Requirements**

In order to use Gulp, our build system/script, you will need to install following dependencies:

+ [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org), Also see [Installing Node.js via package manager](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/installing-node.js-via-package-manager)
+ From root folder run following commands:
  + `npm install -g gulp` installs Gulp globally
  + `npm install` installs our development dependencies from `composer.json` file.
  + And finally run `gulp` to start default Gulp task
  + To run Gulp tasks individually you would run `gulp <task name>` ex. `gulp scss` or `gulp javascript`.
